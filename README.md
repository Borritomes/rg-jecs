# rg-jecs
An unfinished project but I think it has some neat thing
- source engine like developer console
- source engine like input handling
- quake movement (the collision isn't very good; its just blockcasts)
- client prediction
- some cool ui components made with fusion 0.3
- automatic ecs replication (its trash though don't use it)

the rg is for rogue-like because this was originally meant to be a rogue-like game
