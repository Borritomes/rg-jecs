# rg-jecs
An unfinished project but I think it has some neat things
- source engine like developer console (I would recommend using, if you *really* need source syntax you should use vconsole by me instead)
- source engine like input
- quake movement (the collision isn't very good; its just blockcasts)
- client prediction (memory leak though, never gets rid of old cmds)
- some cool ui components made with fusion 0.3
- automatic ecs replication (its trash though don't use it, use replecs)

the rg is for rogue-like because this was originally meant to be a rogue-like game
